 Custom bakery logistics software for Panera Bread 

 Ehhh, how you doughing?*

I am Matthew Mansfield, a software creator, yoga dad, and full-time nerd. I enjoy designing, creating, and coding as well as a bunch of other things. This repository has been created for a software product I'm calling Baby PanPan. Let's dive right in, shall we?

Overview: 
Matthew Mansfield has previously worked for Panera Bread as a General Manager, however, he is currently working for Panera Bread as a baker. These employment titles are not the only two that Matthew has had under his belt. In 1997, Matthew began his public service career as a 9-1-1 operator and eventually worked his way into becoming a police officer. Working in law enforcement allowed Matthew to support himself while he attended college to achieve an associate’s degree in computer programming, an associate’s degree in law enforcement technology, and numerous certificates ranging in areas from communications to medical transcription. Additionally, for more than 8 years, Matthew owned and operated Mansfield Engineering LLC, a software engineering firm that specialized in .Net solutions (both full-stack and stand-alone). For more information about Matthew’s qualifications and work experience please refer to: https://matthewmansfield.me/dl/Matthew-Mansfieled-CL-Resume.pdf. 

As Matthew was working at the (Raintree) Panera Bread in Scottsdale, Arizona, he realized some technological improvements that could be applied to improve overall productivity of the bakery operations team. One of the main recommendations is a software solution designed to increase: productivity, employee accountability, and team member communication between shifts. This software solution would achieve these improvements by providing:
•	Task event notification,
•	Touchscreen digital Pan-ups,
•	Connection with Panera Bread training guides/materials; to allow such things as:
o	Automated insertion into each employees training file of live task completion,
o	Workflow pipeline analysis reporting and
o	Automated task failure/success notifications for employee review purposes 
•	Reference materials to assist bakers in their duties during the course of their shift,
•	Trackable notes which may be logged/sent to team members in the store or distribution center, as applicable (e.g. sending an email message for managers to order more chocolate snaps),
•	Station login and shift progression notification(s) to regional supervisory staff,
•	Connection with entertainment apps such as Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music, to allow bakery teams to listen to music while working,
•	SMS notifications to on-shift bakers when oven alarms go off,
•	Inclusion of an administrative query manager for productivity reporting.

The projected division of software product feature rollout(s) are as follows:

Version 1.0
•	Allow tasks, schedules, and reminders to be entered, displayed, and used.
•	Provide alarm and/or notification(s) for timers and scheduled events (such as reminders to clean the deck oven, wash down shelves, or wash the focaccia rings).
•	Is connected with Panera Bread bakery training materials to include:
	o	Bakery color charts,
	o	Instructions (or ‘how to’) for each product,
	o	Technical specifications for ovens and/or all equipment in the bakery to include:
		-	Vendor information,
		-	Contact information for repairs,
		-	Parts descriptions,
•	Other necessary materials as needed.

Version 2.0
•	Voice recognition integration
•	Set a timer 
•	Display a color chart of any item
•	Connect to Pandora API
•	Sync Bluetooth wireless devices (such as speakers)

Version 3.0
•	Allow task completion events to be directly entered/appended to the Panera Bread employee training file,
•	Furnish documentation for regular employee reviews,
•	Allow task completion emails to be sent to supervisors email address for documentation purposes,
•	Can send SMS notifications upon timer expiration,
•	Allow task completion emails to be sent to supervisors email address for documentation purposes.

Theme:
While still in the sketching stages, this software solution’s name has emerged as Baby PanPan and skinned with a vintage cartoon ambiance. As the story goes, Baby PanPan is a wee baby half pan who fell off a Panera Bread delivery truck enroute to his (home) bakery café. While on his adventure to find his home bakery café, Baby PanPan encounters friends, like Sabrina the Scoring Knife, as well as foes, such as the rotten ol’ Leftovers Larry. These characters are used throughout the application to give harmless artistic personality to the software and soften the business aspect(s) of the raw software data.  

Financing Requirement / Use of Funds: 
Currently, Matthew has a GoFundMe for Baby PanPan, which includes a request for $1,500. This budget is for the following items:
•	Large touchscreen all-in-one PC
•	Developer MySQL server access
•	Hosting fees
•	API fees (if applicable)
•	SSL
•	Domain name

The current GoFundMe request is based upon an extremely limited functioning version of Baby PanPan that Matthew intended on running on the days he was working in the Bakery. This software has been intended to remain a pet project of Matthew’s, however, upon explaining the software to Tim, it was realized that this software may have more value to Panera Bread as a whole.

The financing requirement for this project, production schedule, and resource access availability will require knowledge and skill in its formulation and maintenance, which is essentially a full-time job. As the creator of this application Matthew would love the opportunity to take on this role so that he may continue the work he has already begun. This would also allow for a move into the career field that he is currently finishing his degree in and is passionate about, and for the company that has supported him thus far.

Market Conditions: 
Normally, market conditions include discussion regarding various competitors, however, we are developing in-house; so, the in-house software market should be discussed instead. Panera Bread has several software solutions which are used right now and there are no integration options to allow these programs to talk to one another. Baby PanPan changes all that, which means, this is a brand new market of possibilities.

Competitive Advantages (“Pros”): 
Software Resell Paradigm: Baby PanPan is an internal bakery logistics application designed specifically for Panera Bread and as a software solution there is no external software market where resell may be possible which is known at this time. Components of the software may be compartmentalized and reused in other aspects of coding but the majority of the financial benefits will not be acquired through external software reselling. 

Internal Use Paradigm: The purpose of this application is to streamline the bakery operations flow in order to increase production, transparency, and accountability. The live feeding features of this software provide a tangible market advantage because other bakeries do not have this kind of technology available to them. The company that invests in efforts which increase productivity will always maintain the market advantage over their competitors. This is because we compete not against one another but against time. We all have an equal portion of time given to us and it is what we do with this time that offers us the greater. Baby PanPan is a tool that will enable Baker’s to do more with the time they are allotted; which will allow employees to turn out more production and consequently Panera Bread will make more money.  

Marketing Use Paradigm: Baby PanPan is a cartoon character that has adventures themed in an appealing way that reaches younger audiences. Panera Bread would own rights to Baby PanPan and could explore options of using him, Sabrina, or Leftovers Larry for Catering toward a younger demographic. Matthew has done some preliminary poling at different Gilbert Public Schools and the elementary children all loved the look of Baby PanPan and it got some asking, “What’s a Panera?”. This question was revealing because it showed: 1. Panera Bread does not cater to schools nearly enough and 2. Children do not know what Panera is. Either way, there is an untapped market in the educational system. If Panera Bread has been trying to reach children there is some room for growth, and Baby PanPan seemed to interest them. Should Panera Bread find value in utilizing Baby PanPan to speak to children through his adventures, Panera Bread would have a new marketing tool at their disposal. 

Competitive Disadvantages (“Cons”): 
Complete integration of all features contained within the scope of this executive summary would require the cooperation of Panera Bread. The biggest “con” to not using this software is keeping business as it is now, inside the box, and less efficient than it could be.  

Exit Strategy: 
As mentioned previously, this is software specifically designed to integrate multiple aspects of Panera Bread daily bakery logistical operations and create a new venue of accountability that eases the work-flow pipeline. There are no markets to present this software other than Panera Bread. There is no other use for the cartoon characters used in the theme for this software in any other way than what has been presented herein. The exit strategy included surrendering all content, characters, code, etc. to Panera Bread upon an amicable agreement being met.

Summation:
Baby PanPan is an exciting opportunity for the Panera Bread Bakery Team to take the scattered software components and compile them into one useable system that will benefit overall operations. This executive summary has been produced to open the conversation about how we can bring technology together to make Panera as successful as possible and continue bringing in the dough!
